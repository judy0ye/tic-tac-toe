# Tic Tac Toe

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application allows users to play the classic game of tic tac toe. There are two players in this game, and each player places their token onto the board until they get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. The player who didn't begin the previous game will begin the next game. The banners will reflect the score who goes, bu ff a draw takes place, neither player wins.

### Context:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals include using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a project that allows for user interactions. The project allowed me to practice filtering DOM elements using for loops, and understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM. 
Visual Studio Code, Github, Chrome browser, along with the terminal command-line were used to complete this project.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Buidling a project from scratch is a win!

Challenges:
- Planning out how to execute and where to start with Javascript was difficult, but once I was able to make a small part work, I began to build on top of that.
